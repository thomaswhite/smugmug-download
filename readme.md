SmugMug Download
=====
I'm ending my SmugMug account in July, and I'm gonna move the files somewhere
better, probably S3 or a VPS. As part of this, I need to download the files.

Someone wrote a [SmugMug uploader](http://braindump.dk/tech/2007/10/03/smugmug-uploader/),
and someone else [adapted](http://www.bootswithdefer.com/article.php?story=20071227102301195)
it for downloading, but I haven't found his his code.

Separately, someone made [smugdump](https://github.com/aarone/smugmug-to-flickr),
another person made [smugmug-sync](https://github.com/simoncoles/smugmug-sync),
and another person made [Smuglr](https://github.com/jzellman/Smuglr).

There's also [Smugmug-Get-Images](https://github.com/klinquist/Smugmug-Get-Images/blob/master/getimages.php),
but that seems less pleasant.
